                            While they can be found in the wild, they are
                            no longer wild animals – they’re pack animals.</p>

                            sticking their tongues out in disgust or spitting. One of the ways they communicate is to
                            hum to
                            each other in a range of tones, all with seemingly different meanings.</p>

                            can spit at humans also, but
                            they usually spit at each other to solve misunderstandings in the group.</p>
