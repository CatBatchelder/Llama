                <h1 class="headline">Hello, <br>from Llama</h1>
                <p class="subheadline">Let’s talk Llama-Latin, <br>Pig Latin is so out dated</p>

                <h3 class="msg-title xs-spacing">I’m not actually a wild animal</h3>
                <p class="body-text-2 big-spacing">The reality is that llamas are a domesticated animal. While they can be found in the wild, they are
                    no longer wild animals – they’re pack animals.</p>

                <h3 class="msg-title xs-spacing">I can spit at your enemies 15 feet away</h3>
                <p class="body-text-2 big-spacing">While llamas don’t always spit, it’s a clear sign that they are annoyed at something, or someone.</p>

                <h3 class="msg-title xs-spacing">I am your guard Llama</h3>
                <p class="body-text-2 big-spacing">Sheep and alpaca farmers in the US discovered that llamas were great guard animals, as long as you
                    only have one per herd of sheep.</p>

                <h3 class="msg-title xs-spacing">You don’t need your therapy fish when you have me!</h3>
                <p class="body-text-2 big-spacing">In parts of the US you can find therapy llamas working in nursing homes and schools where they
                    comfort the residents and patients.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title xs-spacing">Person-ality</h2>
                <p class="subheadline medium-spacing">Because we're people too :)</p>

                <h3 class="card-title">Social Butterfly</h3>
                <p class="body-text-3">Llamas are very social animals, so it makes sense that they need a way to communicate other than
                    sticking their tongues out in disgust or spitting. One of the ways they communicate is to hum to
                    each other in a range of tones, all with seemingly different meanings.</p>

                <h3 class="card-title">Spits at people you don’t like</h3>
                <p class="body-text-3">Llamas are known as animals that spit when provoked or threatened. They can spit at humans also, but
                    they usually spit at each other to solve misunderstandings in the group.</p>

                <h3 class="card-title">Resemble the habbits of yourself</h3>
                <p class="body-text-3">Llamas are very intelligent, but stubborn animals. When the load on its back is too heavy, llama will
                    refuse to carry it until some of the load is removed.</p>
